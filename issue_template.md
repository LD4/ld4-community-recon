You can see the use cases gathered so far here: https://github.com/LD4P/ld4-community-recon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ause-case

If you're able, please apply the `use-case` label to your issue (don't worry about it if you cannot).

If you're worried your use case isn't in scope, or is too narrow/broad, or other, please submit it anyway. We want to perform a wide capture of how people in GLAM institutions work on, around, with, or without reconciliation and entity resolution for their (meta)data. Thanks!
